Front end Development Exam

Made with Angular <3

  Angular is a component-based architecture that provides a higher quality of code.
  This project includes:
    
      SASS Styling - easier to use and has lesser complex syntax.
      Bootstrap for Angular(ngBootsrap) - Angular widgets built from the ground up using only Bootstrap 4         
      Angular Material - Component infrastructure and Material Design components for Angular
	   Json Server - Node Module that you can use to create demo rest json webservice.
      Typescript - Gives all the benefits of ES6 (ECMAScript 6), plus more productivity.
You can check other features here : https://angular.io/features      

My Workflow:
1. Downloaded Nodejs and npm package manager.
2. Installed Angular CLI, to create the project and generate components
  The Angular CLI installs the necessary Angular npm packages and other dependencies like SASS & TypeScript and creates a workspace that is ready to run.
3. Installed Bootstrap & angular material for easy layout development.
4. Used Json Server for creating a mock backend server for a dynamic html text page

Usage:
1. Run first the Json Server
( On your terminal run 'json-serve —watch homeText.json' )
2. Then, on a new terminal run the actual project (npm run start)

Disclaimer:
Was not able to export the icons and images from Zeplin(no option to export), thus design is not completely accurate as per Zeplin.
Was only able to create 5 sections from the landing page :(
